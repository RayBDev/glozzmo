  Glozzmo
</h1>

Glozzmo is a multi-page Services Business Theme created with Gatsby and Bootstrap. It includes a lightbox photo gallery and video modal with an extremely fast load time thanks to Gatsby.

## :bookmark_tabs: Technologies Used

1.  **HTML5, CSS3 and Sass**

    This template makes use of HTML5 semantic elements and custom CSS3 to style change the standard Bootstrap classes. Sass was used to keep the additional styling organized.

2.  **Bootstrap**

    Bootstrap was used to style all sections of the template and can therefore be easily modified with additional Bootstrap classes.

3.  **React + Gatsby**

    Gatsby was used as the static page generator for this multi-page template. This was done to take advantage of React components for development. Another advantage was using gatsby-image to automatically generate images based on screen size.
